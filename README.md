## UX 
### Overall Project Goals 

The overall objective of this project is to **provide users with an enjoyable and educational quiz app** that can be easily accessed online. 
This website should be easy to navigate, providing users with a seamless experience as they move from question to question. The website
should be fully responsive and accessible from all devices and screen sizes. 


### User Goals
* **Educational website** that allows users to answer questions on general knowledge.
* **Well placed calls to action** which allow the user to easily navigate to a game or view the high scores.
* Ability to **view high scores** for some added healthy competition.
* **Seamless UX experience for the user** via a planned design with contrasting colours to allow high readability.
* Use the website across all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile. **Fully responsive design**.

### User Stories
Each of the following user stories contributed to the design of the website, to ensure the user had the most effortless experience;
* As a user I would expect to be able to **see my progress as I worked through the questions presented on screen.** This was achieved by
incorporating a progress bar into the design of the quiz. 
* As a user I would enjoy seeing **high scores on the leaderboard for the quiz**. This was achieved by adding a high scores section
that each user can click into. 
* As a user I would expect to be able to **see each potential multi choice answer clearly**, so I could confidently
select whichever option I thought was correct. This was achieved through the design of the multichoice answers, where each
option had a clear border and was labelled A, B, C or D, depending on it's position. 
* As a user I would expect the **multiple choice options to display in random order each time**, i.e. don't show the correct answer
in the same position each time. Logic was implemented to achieve random order for each question displayed.

### Design Decisions
#### Fonts
The chosen font for this project was <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?query=inc">Inconsolata which was provided by Google fonts.</a>
This is a monospaced font, which were widely used in earlier computers. Based on this, it gave an authentic old school feel
to the quiz app, which is why it was selected for this project.

#### Icons
#### Colours
* **Primary: #27496d "Dark Navy"** - This colour will be shown as the background throughout the game. It is quite a dark colour
which is paired with white text to allow contrast for readability. 
* **Secondary: #00909e** - This is a dark turqioise, which compliments the dark navy. 
* Inspiration was taken here from the online tool <a href="https://colorhunt.co/">Color Hunt</a>, where <a href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/180289">this dark 
navy inspired palette</a> was chosen for colours throughout the website.
